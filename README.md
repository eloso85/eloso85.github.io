I updated my previous bio website with bootstrap. Bootstrap made it alot easier for me just program bothe nav and footer. I also added the carousel to my
project page. It made it alot easier to showcase my future project. also the picture in the carusel are interactive. The web page also adapts nicely to differnt sizes.
